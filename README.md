## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am Tianle Zhong, currently a CS PhD at University of Virginia.

I am interested in Systems in LLM Training / Inference / Triton. 

and sometimes fortunate enough to publish papers on them :)

Currently I am a research scientist intern at ByteDance, 

building efficient & easy-to-use [large-scale MoE training system](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/VeOmni/blob/main/docs/tutorials/ep_fsdp2.md).
